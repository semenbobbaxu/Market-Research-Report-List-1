<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Barrier Membranes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Resorbable Membranes</li><li>Non-resorbable Membranes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Barrier Membranes Market is categorized into two main types: resorbable and non-resorbable membranes. Resorbable membranes are made from materials that break down naturally in the body over time, eliminating the need for surgical removal, making them ideal for applications like guided bone regeneration. In contrast, non-resorbable membranes are constructed from materials that do not degrade, providing long-term structural support but requiring extraction after their purpose is fulfilled. Both types play crucial roles in dental and orthopedic procedures.</p></p>
